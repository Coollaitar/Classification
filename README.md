## Water Potability Detection
This repository contains a machine-learning project focused on classifying the potability of water samples. The goal is to determine whether a sample from a body of water is potable, given its chemical paramters

#### Problem Statement

The main objective of this dataset is to assess and predict water potability based on water quality attributes. It can be used for evaluating the safety and suitability of water sources for human consumption, making informed decisions about water treatment, and ensuring compliance with water quality standards.

#### Features
The features used in this project include:

pH: The pH level of the water.
Hardness: Water hardness, a measure of mineral content.
Solids: Total dissolved solids in the water.
Chloramines: Chloramines concentration in the water.
Sulfate: Sulfate concentration in the water.
Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of the water.
Organic_carbon: Organic carbon content in the water.
Trihalomethanes: Trihalomethanes concentration in the water.
Turbidity: Turbidity level, a measure of water clarity.
Potability: Target variable; indicates water potability with values 1 (potable) and 0 (not potable).
